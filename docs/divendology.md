### 3. **Payout Ratio (Sustainability)**

> Is the dividend actually safe?

* Measured as a % of earnings (or FFO for REITs, DCF for pipelines).
* Sweet spot: **40â€“60% for most sectors**, lower is safer.
* If the ratio is too high, it raises a red flag that dividends might be cut.


### 5. **Dividend Safety Score (Optional, via Tools)**

Sites like **Simply Safe Dividends** give dividend safety ratings (0-100 scale) based on:

* Cash flow
* Debt levels
* Payout ratio
* Earnings consistency
* Recession performance

### 6. **Total Return Potential (Yield + Growth)**

> Think long-term compounding.

* Dividendologists care about **total return** but emphasize **income first**.
* A stock yielding 4% with 6% annual dividend growth is attractive for compoundingâ€”even if the share price stays flat.
