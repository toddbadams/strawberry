**Problem:** You're looking to understand how *dividendology*‚Äîa style of dividend-focused investing‚Äîvalues dividend growth stocks. Great question, because the way dividend-focused investors think about value is **very different** from traditional value or growth investors.





### 3. **Payout Ratio (Sustainability)**

> Is the dividend actually safe?

* Measured as a % of earnings (or FFO for REITs, DCF for pipelines).
* Sweet spot: **40‚Äì60% for most sectors**, lower is safer.
* If the ratio is too high, it raises a red flag that dividends might be cut.

---

### 4. **Valuation Metrics (P/E, P/FCF, PEG)**

> They still look at fundamentals, but with a dividend lens.

* **P/E** (Price to Earnings): Lower P/E can mean undervaluation.
* **P/FCF** (Price to Free Cash Flow): Especially important for capital-intensive sectors.
* **PEG**: P/E relative to growth‚Äîif PEG < 1, it's usually attractive.

---

### 5. **Dividend Safety Score (Optional, via Tools)**

Sites like **Simply Safe Dividends** give dividend safety ratings (0-100 scale) based on:

* Cash flow
* Debt levels
* Payout ratio
* Earnings consistency
* Recession performance

---

### 6. **Total Return Potential (Yield + Growth)**

> Think long-term compounding.

* Dividendologists care about **total return** but emphasize **income first**.
* A stock yielding 4% with 6% annual dividend growth is attractive for compounding‚Äîeven if the share price stays flat.

---

### üõ†Ô∏è A Real-World Example: Johnson & Johnson (JNJ)

* **Current yield:** 3.3%
* **5-year dividend growth rate:** \~6%
* **Payout ratio:** \~45%
* **Dividend streak:** 61 years
* **Dividend safety score (SSD):** 99/100

From a dividendologist's perspective? ‚úÖ Solid.
