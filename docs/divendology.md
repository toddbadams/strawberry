**Problem:** You're looking to understand how *dividendology*‚Äîa style of dividend-focused investing‚Äîvalues dividend growth stocks. Great question, because the way dividend-focused investors think about value is **very different** from traditional value or growth investors.

### ‚úÖ What Is Dividendology?

**Dividendology** isn't a formal academic discipline‚Äîit's a nickname used by dividend growth investors who focus on:

* **Sustainable and growing dividends**
* **High yield relative to history**
* **Strong fundamentals that support dividend safety**

They tend to prioritize **income stability and compounding** over short-term capital gains.

### üß† How Dividendology Values Dividend Growth Stocks

Here are the **key valuation pillars** dividendologists use to decide if a dividend stock is worth buying:

---

### 1. **Dividend Yield (Relative to Its Own History)**

> **Rule of Thumb:** "Buy when the yield is high vs. historical average."

* If a stock typically yields 2.5%, but now yields 3.2%, that may indicate **undervaluation**.
* Tools like FastGraphs, Simply Safe Dividends, or YieldChart can show **historical yield bands**.

**Formula:**
`Current Dividend Yield = Annual Dividend / Current Share Price`

---

### 2. **Dividend Growth Rate**

> **Why it matters:** A growing dividend = rising income and often signals financial health.

* Most dividendologists want at least **5-10% annual dividend growth**.
* Some are OK with slower growth if the **yield is high** (think utilities, REITs).
* They use the **Chowder Rule** to combine growth + yield.

**Chowder Rule:**
`Dividend Yield + 5-Year Dividend Growth Rate > 12%`
(Thresholds vary slightly depending on the investor.)

---

### 3. **Payout Ratio (Sustainability)**

> Is the dividend actually safe?

* Measured as a % of earnings (or FFO for REITs, DCF for pipelines).
* Sweet spot: **40‚Äì60% for most sectors**, lower is safer.
* If the ratio is too high, it raises a red flag that dividends might be cut.

---

### 4. **Valuation Metrics (P/E, P/FCF, PEG)**

> They still look at fundamentals, but with a dividend lens.

* **P/E** (Price to Earnings): Lower P/E can mean undervaluation.
* **P/FCF** (Price to Free Cash Flow): Especially important for capital-intensive sectors.
* **PEG**: P/E relative to growth‚Äîif PEG < 1, it's usually attractive.

---

### 5. **Dividend Safety Score (Optional, via Tools)**

Sites like **Simply Safe Dividends** give dividend safety ratings (0-100 scale) based on:

* Cash flow
* Debt levels
* Payout ratio
* Earnings consistency
* Recession performance

---

### 6. **Total Return Potential (Yield + Growth)**

> Think long-term compounding.

* Dividendologists care about **total return** but emphasize **income first**.
* A stock yielding 4% with 6% annual dividend growth is attractive for compounding‚Äîeven if the share price stays flat.

---

### üõ†Ô∏è A Real-World Example: Johnson & Johnson (JNJ)

* **Current yield:** 3.3%
* **5-year dividend growth rate:** \~6%
* **Payout ratio:** \~45%
* **Dividend streak:** 61 years
* **Dividend safety score (SSD):** 99/100

From a dividendologist's perspective? ‚úÖ Solid.
